					You can see the original version repo <a href="https://github.com/tomBeach/_Project_1">here</a>, but for the upgraded and refactored version I wanted to try something different. I chose a grid design to explore ways of manipulating the DOM and playing with design alternatives. A quick coding test suggested the basic functionality would be fairly straight-forward:
				</p>
				<ul class="introText">
					<li>make a 12 by 18 table of cells</li>
					<li>select them individually or in groups</li>
					<li>apply classes and other attributes at will</li>
					<li>append images or divs to create layers or features above the grid</li>
					<li>store parameters and behaviors in screen, player, display and game objects</li>

						<div class="infoText">The <span class="hilite">grid</span> is a 12 x 18 table of 50x50px cells.</div>
						<div class="infoText">Game components are generated by defining <span class="hilite">regions</span> on the grid.</div>
						<div class="infoText">Regions are located via their <span class="hilite">indexCell</span> which has row and column attributes, and are further defined by width, height and merge attributes</div>
						<div class="infoText"><span class="hilite">Width</span> and <span class="hilite">height</span> define size (in the number of cells wide or tall)</div>
						<div class="infoText">A <span class="hilite">merged</span> region is created by a single spanned cell; <span class="hilite">ummerged</span> regions result from a series of individual cells.</div>
						<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>
						<div class="infoText">Rowspans and colspans had to be considered when locating the index cells on affected rows.</div>
						<div class="infoText">In this example, an index cell in column 13 as actually in column 10 due to the spanned cells in the same row, so it's 'cell address' needs to be adjusted programatically.</div>
						<div class="infoText">Tracking rowspans can be more challenging.</div>
						<div class="infoText">When an index cell is in the same row, rowspans have no effect.</div>
						<div class="infoText">If the index cell is in a row containing spanned cells, the number of columns in that row is reduced.</div>
						<div class="infoText">Finding rowspanned cells requires looking at all rows above the target row to check for rowspans -- a cumbersome process.</div>
						<div class="infoText">My solution was to set up a table of rowspaned cell records, each of which is initialize to FALSE.</div>
						<div class="infoText">When a rowspan is assigned, all affected cells in the span region are set to TRUE in the record table.</div>
						<div class="infoText">This way, only table settings in target rows need to be checked for rowspans.</div>
						<div class="infoText">Finally, since regions may span both columns and rows, both span types need to be checked in order to correct the 'target' column for regions to the right of the spanned region.</div>
